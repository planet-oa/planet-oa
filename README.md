i don't got a lot to say besides the obvious common sense.<br/>
i mainly like to interact w/ people who like the same media as me!<br/>
i'm pretty awkward, and i know pony.town is a wild rodeo with a few bad eggs.<br/>

**i'm not very active on here!** if you wish to be friends, you can ask!<br/>
please keep in mind i don't like to talk to people who are way younger than me.<br/>

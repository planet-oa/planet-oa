### **BYI:**<br/>
i don't got a lot to say besides the obvious common sense.<br/>
i mainly like to interact w/ people who like the same media as me!<br/>
i'm pretty awkward, and i know pony.town is a wild rodeo with a few bad eggs.<br/>
\
**i'm not very active on here!** if you wish to be friends, you can ask!<br/>
please keep in mind i don't like to talk to people who are way younger than me.<br/>
i won't friend anyone under 16, and even then I am uncomfortable being close friends with minors.<br/>
**please iwc if you are younger than me as i am 19.**
***
### **ETC:**<br/>
you can go to my [straw page](https://oaplanet.straw.page) for more info!<br/>
\
i'm not on pony.town often, and only on it w/ friends!<br/>

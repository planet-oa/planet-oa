### **INTRO:**<br/>
hi, i go by a few usernames. **oan-planet**, **planet.oa**...<br/>
wherever you found me from on pony.town, i'm known as **indy** to my friends!<br/>
***
### **BYI:**<br/>
i don't got a lot to say besides the obvious common sense.<br/>
i mainly like to interact w/ people who like the same media as me!<br/>
i'm pretty awkward, and i know pony.town is a wild rodeo with a few bad eggs.<br/>
\
**i'm not very active on here!** if you wish to be friends, you can ask!<br/>
please keep in mind i don't like to talk to people who are way younger than me.<br/>
i won't friend anyone under 16, and even then I am uncomfortable being close friends with minors.<br/>
**please iwc if you are younger than me as i am 19. please be safe online y'all!**
***
### **INTERESTS:**<br/>
i'm more of a sci-fi person, and i like old things!<br/>
i like some **anime**, mostly older ones and a few newer ones!<br/>
i also like **comics**! i specifically collect **DC comics**!<br/>
\
i mainly like **the flash (barry allen)** and **green lantern (hal jordan)**!<br/>
my other interests consist of movies/tv series like:<br/>
**back to the future, terminator, matrix, stargate, astro boy, etc.**<br/>
\
don't be afraid to talk to me if you like either of these!!<br/>
***
### **ETC:**<br/>
i'm on and off on pony.town and usually i come on as whatever pony i choose.<br/>
usually that'll range to whatever interest i'm in currently, but for the main ones...<br/>
i'll mostly be **hal jordan/green lantern**, **krillin**, and **astro boy**.<br/>
\
anyway-- idm chatting! it's cool to meet fellow dc fans on here once in a while!
